# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

## Technical problems
Seeing as I recently had worked on a JPA-project I had already solved most of the typical maven-issues previous to this hand-in. I only struggled a bit understanding what was required to configure the datatbase, seeing as I don't have any experience with derby. I chose to only use the IDE but if I were to spend more time on the database-implementation I would definetly use a locally served database to ensure everything worked fine. 
The way i confirmed the table-creations was by displaying the entity-relationships in IntelliJ as seen on the screenshots. 
For simplicity I used the jpa-example for both exercise 1 and 2, just altering the models and configuration-file persistance.xml. In the current repo only the code from experiment 2 is present.
