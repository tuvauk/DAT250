# Tuva: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 4
## Technical difficulties
I didn't really experience any new technical issues this time, experiment 1 went pretty fast. 
I managed to push the git repo to my own repo without any issues this time. 

## Experiment 2
Seeing as i used the repo from experiment 1 to do experiment 2 the code isnÂ´t optimal but the api works as it should. 
I would probably implement autogenerated id's in the future, and make separaqte restcontrollers. All the code is currently located in the App.java
