# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 5
## Tuva Kvals√∏ren

I chose to put all the code for the four individual experiments in the same spring-application, 
so it got quite messy but all four experiments went okay and seemed to work out fine. 
I have initialized spring projects before and didn't really run into any technical difficulties. 
The app.gradle part did not work according to the tutorial, and i didn't spend to much time trying to fix it at this point.
