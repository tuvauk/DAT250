# Software Technology Lab 1: Development Environment and Cloud Deployment
## *Tuva Kvalsøren*

### Technical Difficulties 
I didn´t really encounter any technical issues seeing as I already had the required software installed and mostly up to date. 
The only issue really was that i had used maximum capasity of free apps in heroku. Fixed this by deleting the existing apps. 
### Validation 
To validate that the software environment were actually running i simply hosted the app locally and checked that it worked and displayed my changes.
This is usually a good indication that things are up and running okay.
### Other
I skipped the step where credit-card validation were needed, just because i didn´t realluy find this step neccesary for my understanding of the platform.
Some of the following steps didn´t specify if I were supposed to follow them, or if it was only for information. 
So i didn´t insert any data into the database but the database-config with postgres worked fine.
